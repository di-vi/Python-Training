# A program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours.
Use the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay().



def computepay(h, r):
    h=float(hrs)
    r=float(rate)
    if(h<40):
        grosspay = h * r
    elif(h>40):
        output1=40 * r
        calc=h - 40
        output2=calc * 1.5 * r
        grosspay = output1 + output2
    return grosspay

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter Rate:")
p = computepay(hrs,rate)
print("Pay", p)
