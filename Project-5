# A program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values. 
sample data: http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt



count = 0
total = 0
fname = raw_input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
for line in fh:
    if line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):
        count =count + 1
        colon = line.find(":")
        
        val = line[colon+1 : ]
        valu = float(val)
        #value = valu.rstrip()
        total = total + valu
    continue
print("Average spam confidence:", total/count)
