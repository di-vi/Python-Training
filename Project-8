# A program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. 
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

sample data: http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt
Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.



name = input("Enter file:")
d = dict()
if len(name) < 1:
    name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
count = 0
for h in handle:
    if h.startswith('From '):
        h = h.split()
        h = h[5]
        g = h.find(':')
        hh = h[ : g]
        d[hh] = d.get(hh,0)+1
        count = count + 1
l = list()
for k, v in d.items():
    a = (k,v)
    l.append(a)
    l.sort()    
for k,v in l:
    print(k , v)
