# A program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. 
Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers.
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number.

    num = raw_input("Enter a number:")
    if num == "done":
            break
    try:
        fnum = float(num)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue
    if smallest is None:
        smallest = fnum
        largest = fnum
    if fnum < smallest:
