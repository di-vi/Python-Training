# A program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.



name = input("Enter file:")
fh = open(name)

d = dict()
bigcount = None
bigemail = None

for hi in fh:
    if hi.startswith('From '):
        hi=hi.split()
        hi = hi[1]
        d[hi] = d.get(hi,0)+1
for hi,count in d.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigcount = count
        bigemail = hi
print(bigemail, bigcount)
